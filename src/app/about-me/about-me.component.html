        <p class="text-slate-400 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Born and raised in Toronto, I'm a full-stack developer with a passion for building software applications and solving complex problems. Beyond coding, I'm deeply committed to making a meaningful impact on the world around me, whether through technology or by giving back to the community.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-400 leading-relaxed">
          I love playing sports. In particular, volleyball and basketball. I've been getting into baseball as well! I'm also passionate about chess. I try to get better by doing chess puzzles every day. Reading is another favorite pastime of mine; my all-time favorite book is "A Tree Grows in Brooklyn" by Betty Smith - I like how it captures the resilience of ordinary people and how the author writes with a particular kind of realism. I also enjoy being involved in school clubs and teaching others.
